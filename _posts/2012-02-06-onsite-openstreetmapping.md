[AJ](https://twitter.com/#!/aj_ashton) [beat me to it](http://ajashton.ca/2012/02/06/geohashing-and-openstreetmapping.html) but this past weekend the two of us drove out to Manassas National Battlefield Park to visit Saturday's [XKCD Geohash location for Columbia heights](http://carabiner.peeron.com/xkcd/map/map.html?date=2012-02-04&lat=38&long=-78&zoom=8&abs=1) (see the xkcd comic for context [here.](http://www.xkcd.com/426))

It was my first time doing something like this and I had a great time. We used [OSMTracker for Android](https://market.android.com/details?id=me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker&hl=en) - an excellent tool for recording tracks and capturing points of interest. I haven't come across an equivalent iphone app that do these two things together well.

Coming home with fresh collected data is strangely enjoyable.
