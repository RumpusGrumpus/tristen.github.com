I'm starting anew. Since I started working at [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/team/tristen-brown) in January of this year I've thought about building a new site that was technically simpler, that wasn't about showing portfolio work and that wasn't Drupal.

Instead, I want a site for myself that's focused on writing, code and drawings. A more selfish place to document my progression and ideas. I'm going to try and draw a little stamp to go a long with each date and I'll be updating the way the site looks as content grows.

The site has a different layout on browsers that support [media queries](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries) 

    @media all and (orientation:portrait) {
      /* css goes here */
      }

######Colophon

For fonts, I'm using helvetica as a base and [font fonts](https://www.fontfont.com), '[Meta Serif Web Pro](http://typekit.com/fonts/ff-meta-serif-web-pro)' for paragraphs via Typekit.

[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) powers the site and [GitHub pages](http://pages/github.com) hosts it.
